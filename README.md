## Background

Snake is a video game concept in which the player moves around a line (the snake) which grows in length.

## Gameplay

The player controls a square on a bordered screen by using up, down, left, and right arrow keys. At the start of the game, the length of the snake is 1. A piece of food is randomly placed on the screen. The player must move the snake to the food to grow the snake in length. When a piece of food is consumed, the snake's tail increases by 1 square.

The player's score is proportional to the length of the tail.

As the square moves forward, and its tail follows. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
