## Purpose

The purpose of this project is create a version of the game Snake in Python

## Background

Snake is a video game concept in which the player moves around a line (the snake) which grows in length

## Gameplay

The player controls the snake's head on a bordered screen by using up, down, left, and right arrow keys. At the start of the game, the length of the snake is 1. A piece of food is randomly placed on the screen. The player moves the snake to the food to grow the snake in length. When a piece of food is consumed, the snake's tail increases by 1 square, and the score is increased. 

As the snake's head moves forward, its tail follows. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
